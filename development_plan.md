SportIQ is an intelligent sports analysis platform targeting the China-ASEAN region. Through wearable device data and artificial intelligence technology, it provides scientific training support, fatigue monitoring, risk warning, and long-term performance analysis for athletes, coaches, and sports organizations. The core goal of the platform is to make training quantifiable, interpretable, and predictable, thereby improving sports performance, reducing injury risks, and promoting regional sports digital transformation. Unlike traditional systems that only track simple data such as steps and calories, SportIQ can deeply understand exercise quality, rhythm changes, and environmental factors' impact on sports. It represents a future-oriented sports intelligence infrastructure.

SportIQ consists of four core modules: the PatchHAR motion recognition engine, statistical and topological structure feature analysis module, Sports LLM sports large model inference system, and coach and athlete application interfaces. The PatchHAR engine uses patch-based Transformers to perform deep parsing of motion signals; statistical and topological features are used to judge movement quality and stability; the sports large model is responsible for understanding long-term behavioral changes and providing personalized recommendations. The platform supports multi-project and multi-scenario applications, including football, basketball, athletics, fitness training, and more, providing unified intelligent analysis capabilities for sports institutions at different levels.

SportIQ's core technological advantages include: Transformer-based PatchHAR temporal modeling that can accurately recognize complex motion patterns; Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for extracting movement structure characteristics, capable of identifying rhythm disorders, fatigue, and technical decline; self-supervised learning mechanisms that utilize large amounts of unlabeled data to improve model stability; and Sports LLM that combines sports performance with environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, air quality, etc.) to provide interpretable training recommendations. The platform adopts a cloud-edge collaborative architecture, ensuring a balance between mobile real-time feedback and cloud-side deep analysis.

The target market includes sports departments of Chinese universities, primary and secondary school sports schools, professional and semi-professional clubs, fitness institutions, training centers, and sports research units. The ASEAN region (such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, etc.) is experiencing rapid growth in sports technology demand, with intelligent training and youth training dataization being important trends. SportIQ's low-cost deployment, device compatibility, and bilingual interface (Chinese-English) make it naturally adapted to the integrated sports development needs of China-ASEAN.

SportIQ adopts a SaaS subscription model, with sports institutions subscribing annually to the coach-side and team management systems; athletes can use premium personalized functions through monthly subscriptions. The platform also collaborates with wearable device manufacturers, providing data interfaces and revenue-sharing models. Additionally, it offers premium analysis services such as personalized training plans, team performance reports, and specialized risk assessments. In the future, it will export comprehensive ASEAN regional solutions and technology licensing, establishing long-term regional cooperation mechanisms.

The project will be implemented in phases. The first phase will conduct pilots with partner universities in Guangxi, verifying technology and scenario adaptability. The second phase will expand to different sports projects and collaborate with major sports universities and training centers, while launching small-scale pilots in ASEAN countries. The third phase will establish regional sports data centers, expanding influence through government cooperation and event partnerships. The ultimate goal is to construct a "China-ASEAN Intelligent Sports Training Network," enabling cross-regional data sharing and training cooperation.

Currently, most sports products in the market are either basic pedometer systems or professional but costly systems, lacking interpretability and localized support. SportIQ's advantages lie in high-precision recognition, fatigue and risk analysis, LLM inference capabilities, and localized low-cost deployment. Compared to foreign products, SportIQ has stronger competitiveness in language, policy compliance, hardware compatibility, and regional cooperation.

The team consists of members from multiple fields including artificial intelligence, sports science, signal processing, software development, and industrial cooperation. Core members have experience in deep learning, human behavior recognition, and wearable technology analysis. The team also has advisors from universities, sports institutions, and industry, providing professional guidance for product implementation and market expansion.

Over the next three years, the platform will gradually enter a scaling phase from the pilot stage. The first year will focus on demonstration projects as the primary revenue source while improving product functionality; the second year will expand SaaS revenue and data analysis service revenue; the third year will achieve rapid growth through ASEAN market cooperation. It is expected to achieve rapid revenue growth within three years, with gross profit margins increasing annually and forming a healthy business loop.

The project plans to seek initial strategic funding for technology research and development, market expansion, cloud infrastructure, hardware adaptation, and overseas localization work. The funding will support rapid implementation, product iteration, and establishing regional demonstration projects, providing a foundation for subsequent scaling.

SportIQ is committed to becoming the leading AI intelligent sports platform in the China-ASEAN region. Through advanced technologies such as motion modeling, topological analysis, self-supervised learning, and LLM inference, the platform will promote digital and intelligent upgrading of sports training, help athletes improve performance and health levels, and create a solid technological foundation for regional sports cooperation.
